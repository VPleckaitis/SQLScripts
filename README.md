# TheFixes
Various SQL scripts and tools and etc, that are useful for various tasks (or if someone somewhere somehow messed up and you don't know where to start).

All systems/applications eventually tend to do poo-poo and doo-doo, flip the table and cry in the corner (unless You're Jon Skeet and you write bug free compiled binary code from the start). To help pacify / debug / fix whatever is crying in the corner (it might actually be sysadmin and/or developer, in that case I'm sorry - this repository might not help but some alcohol will) you need to do something. Thus #TheFixes.

This repository will contain very different technologies (SQL, C#, Bash, Python - no malbolge, so you're safe), since there is no one-fits-all solution and cannot be.
